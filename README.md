 LeagueDB is a database utility for the video game "League of Legends", developed by Riot Games. It will allow you to receive database contents for numerous different tables in the game data, as well as results for a number of different queries, all from an easy to use interface. You can also export the data as a .csv file, for more advanced data analysis.
  
  LeagueDB is built for a Windows operating system with Java 11 or later installed.
